### Modules Overview
1. **Introduction to Solidity**  
   Setup, basic syntax, state variables, functions, and simple storage contract.
2. **Address Interactions**  
   Working with `address` type: sending/receiving Ether, calling other contracts, security checks.
3. **Reference Types**  
   Arrays, structs, mappings, strings, memory vs. storage, and gas-efficient patterns.
4. **Applied Solidity**  
   Build a voting system, use inheritance for reusable access control, and combine concepts in mini dApps.
